What is Recycling of elements in a vector?
Recycling happens when we apply operation with two vectors of diffeent length
R automatically recycles, or repeats, the shorter vector until it is long enough to match the longer one.

3. Give an example of recycling of elements.
EXAMPLE:
> c(1,2,4) + c(6,0,9,20,22)
[1]  7  2 13 21 24

The shorter vector was recycled, so the operation was taken to be as follows:
> c(1,2,4,1,2) + c(6,0,9,20,22)
