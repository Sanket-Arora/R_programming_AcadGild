#ASSIGNMENT 3.1
#The purpose is to create a lower triangular matrix, that is a matrix whose
elements below the main diagonal are non-zero, the others are left
untouched to their initialized zero value.

mXn <- matrix(1:25, nrow=5, ncol=5)
#Convert all elements to 0
apply(mXn, c(1, 2), function(x) 0)
#Create lower triangular matrix whose elements below the main diagonal are non-zero and 
#the others are left untouched to their initialized zero value.
mXn [upper.tri(mXn)] <- 0 
#Also converting main diagonal elements to 0
mXn [upper.tri(mXn ,diag=TRUE)] <- 0
